# Metanet Browser Extension

## Introduction
The Metanet Browser Extension is a software project designed to extend the functionality of web browsers by integrating the Metanet concept. The Metanet is a decentralized network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling secure and versatile storage, sharing, and transacting of data, digital assets, and applications.

## Features
- Blockchain Integration: Connects to the Bitcoin blockchain for seamless interaction with the Metanet.
- Decentralized Identity: Empowers users with self-sovereign identities on the Metanet.
- File Storage and Sharing: Provides efficient and distributed file storage solutions.
- Content Publishing: Enables users to publish content directly on the Metanet, ensuring permanence and immutability.
- Smart Contracts and DApps: Supports smart contract execution and development of decentralized applications.
- User Interface and Browser Integration: Offers a user-friendly interface integrated with web browsers.

## Problem Statement

The existing web browsing experience lacks an effective solution for interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Users face challenges in securely storing, accessing, and sharing data within these DApps. Additionally, there is a need for a user-friendly interface, in the form of a website or extension, that simplifies the interaction with Bitcoin-based DApps and provides seamless integration for storing and sharing data securely.
